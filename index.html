                            <p>I matriculated with five distinctions in Mathematics,
                                 Physical Science, Life Science, Geography, and 
                                 Life Orientation, with an average of 82%. High school 
                                 was a time of growth and learning, and I’m proud 
                                 of the achievements that helped prepare me for
                                  my journey in Computer Science.
