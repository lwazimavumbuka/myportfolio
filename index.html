                            <p>I matriculated with five distinctions in Mathematics,

                                 was a time of growth and learning, and I’m proud 
                                 of the achievements that helped prepare me for

                    <p>
                        This assignment involved correcting and extending a multithreaded Java simulation of patrons in a club, 
                        ensuring adherence to behavioral rules and synchronization constraints. Using synchronization mechanisms, 
                        I resolved concurrency issues to maintain safety and liveness, implementing features like entrance/exit access
                         limits, realistic patron movement, and deadlock prevention. The club simulation included components like a 
                         grid-based layout, counters to track patrons, and a pause/resume function. Built using Java.
